<p>Hi there. My name is <a href="http://wattydev.com" target="_blank">Spencer</a>, and I built this card game tracker app. I am a Frontend Developer and built this as a side project.</p>
<p>I have been playing card games with my friends for a while and kept having to search for an app to keep track of things for the games we were playing. Some apps had some features, and other apps had others. So, I wanted to build something that did everything that I wanted it to do.</p>
<p>If you find this app to be useful, then great! I'm glad to hear it. This is a personal project of mine, so I'm not paid for this work. I do not want to charge anything for it, but if you feel inclined to, you can visit the <a ui-sref="donate">Donate</a> page to show me your appreciation of the app. If you have any suggestions of improvements to the app, or if you have some games that you want to use that this app isn't built for, let me know in the <a ui-sref="feedback">Feedback</a> page. I can't promise that I will fulfill every request, but I'll give it a shot.</p>
